# micropython-fingerprint
[MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) library for reading ZhianTec finger print sensors.

This MicroPython library is based on the original [pyfingerprint](https://github.com/bastianraschke/pyfingerprint)
for the Raspberry Pi and has the same [German free software license](http://www.d-fsl.org).

As with the original library it should work with ZFM-20, ZFM-60, etc sensors. I have been testing with the R503 sensor.

It appears to be working, but I have not yet verified all the functionality.
