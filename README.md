# micropython-fingerprint
Micropython library for reading ZhianTec finger print sensors.

This micropython library is based on the original [pyfingerprint](https://github.com/bastianraschke/pyfingerprint) 
for the Raspberry Pi and has the same [German free software license](http://www.d-fsl.org).

It appears to be working, but I have not yet verified all the functionality.
